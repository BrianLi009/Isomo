# Our Robust Research on Recruitment Bias
## Unconscious Bias Could Be Anywhere
### The Name Game :mag:
Applicants' name provides a lot more information than we think. Based on a simple name, we can deduct someone's **gender**, **ethnicity** and **race**. Experiments have shown that simply changing the name on an application can **significantly alter call-back rates**, even for employers with a public commitment to equal opportunity. Moreover, despite the significant amount of investment spent annually on diversity training programmes, there’s little to no evidence that they work. 
### Application Order and Timing :watch:
Research shows that by being the first couple applicants, the chances of getting an interview is the **highest**. Another interesting result is that it matters a lot who comes before the applicants when recruiter is viewing the application.
### Individual Bias :mega:
Studies have shown that crowds will **beat experts** in the recruitment process when they are:
- **Diverse** – they bring varying degrees of knowledge and insight;
- **Independent** – individuals’ opinions aren’t affected by the surrounding co-workers;
- **Decentralised** – they each have their specialization and know how to utilize them;
- **Aggregated** – a mechanism exists to process views and convert them into collective intelligence.
