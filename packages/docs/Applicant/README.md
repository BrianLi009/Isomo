# Applicant User Journey

## Sign Up Page

The user will provide 4 pieces of information:
- Name
- Email
- Phone Number
- Password
- **Optionally**, they could sign up using 3rd party partners (Eg. LinkedIn)

The choice to omit the option for username is intentional. Since we want to conceal the identity of the applicant as much as possible, the username will be auto-generated.

## Profile Setup Page

To simplify the process, the user will upload their resume. We would then proceed to extract important to complete their profile.

Information extracted will be the applicant's:
- Education
- Skills
- Projects
- Experience (work and volunteer)
- Accomplishments/awards

**Note:** There are limitations to the extraction algorithm, so the user will be able to freely edit their profile at any time.

In addition, the user can choose to provide their **job position interests** and **short bios**. This is highly recommended because it allows for company to find you easier.

This is the central hub for the applicant. The dashboard is separated into 4 main sections:

- Profile Status
  - Display the completion progress on the profile
