## Issues we are trying to solve
The current recruitment process could be time consuming and sometimes contain unintentional bias. People can fall prey to collective decision making errors similar to “herd behavior’, social hierarchy bias, and social conformity bias. These above challenges have become obstacles for companies that are striving to create a diversified environment through fair recruitment.

## Our Vision
True equality in the recruitment process by filter out the biases(e.g. Race, gender) to the applicant, simply analysis the applicants based on their skillset.
